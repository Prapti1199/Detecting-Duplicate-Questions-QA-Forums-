# Detecting-Duplicate-Questions-QA-Forums-
The task of identifying duplicated questions can be viewed as an instance of the paraphrase identiﬁcation problem, which is a well-studied NLP task that uses natural language sentence matching (NLSM) to determine whether two sentences are paraphrase or not (2). This task has wide array of useful NLP application. For example, in question-and-answer (QA) forums, there are vast numbers of duplicate questions. Identifying these duplicates and consolidating their answers increases the efﬁciency of such QA forums. Moreover, identifying questions with the same semantic content could help web-scale question answering systems that are increasingly concentrating on retrieving focused answers to users’ queries.
